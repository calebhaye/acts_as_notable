== Resources

Install

  Rails

   * To install as a plugin:
 
    script/plugin install http://github.com/calebhaye/acts_as_noteable.git


 Generate your note model:
 
 script/generate note
 
 Then migrate your database:
 
 rake db:migrate

== Usage
 * Make your ActiveRecord model act as noteable.
 
 class Model < ActiveRecord::Base
 	acts_as_noteable
 end
 
 * Add a note to a model instance
 
 noteable = Model.create
 noteable.notes.create(:title => "First note.", :note => "This is the first note.")

 * Fetch notes for a noteable model:
 
 noteable = Model.find(1)
 notes = noteable.notes.recent.limit(10).all

 # Following doesn't work/make sense to me. Leaving for historical sake -- Jack
 # * Each note reference noteable object
 #
 # model = Model.find(1)
 # model.notes.get(0).noteable == model
